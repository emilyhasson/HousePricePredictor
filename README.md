# HousePricePredictor

Prediction of house sale value using machine learning in Python.

## Features

In this project I compare several linear regression algorithms for the purpose of predicting house sale values. Algorithms used include Ordinal Least Square, Ridge regression, Bayesian regression, Lasso regression, and Elastic Net regression. I also started with an exploratory data analysis using Matplotlib to visualize correlations.
